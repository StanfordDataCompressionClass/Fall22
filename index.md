The amount of data being stored and transferred by humanity is growing exponentially,
 with 10s of zettabytes (1 zettabyte = 1 trillion gigabytes) being generated every year. 
 Data compression, the field dedicated to representing information in a compact manner, 
 plays a critical role in enabling this scale. 
 Since Shannon described the foundations of data compression in his seminal 1948 paper, 
 there have been several theoretical and practical breakthroughs. 
 Progress in storage and communication technologies has led to increasing capacities, 
 but there is a perpetual cat and mouse chase between growing capacity and the amount of data 
 required by new technologies. 
 Compression remains a vibrant area of research fueled by the constant flow of new types of information sources
 such as genomic, multimedia, sensor, AR/VR 3D point clouds, and astronomic, to name a few. Moreover, 
 recent research in compression has focused on utilizing the diverse computational resources ranging from IoT devices 
 to GPUs running deep neural nets. Another active area of research includes novel modes of compression, 
 including computation on compressed data, random access capabilities and compression in hardware. 
 The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to foundations of data compression while at the same time 
 providing exposure to the recent advances in this field.

 Throughout the course, both theoretical and practical aspects of compression will be covered, with equal emphasis. 
 A crucial element of the course is learning through doing - the students will work on a pedagogical data compression 
 library and implement specific compression techniques. The first part of the course introduces techniques for entropy 
 coding and for lossless compression. The second part covers lossy compression including techniques
 for image and video compression. The last part of the course will cover advanced theoretical topics and application 
 domains, depending on available time and student interest, along with guest lectures from experts in the area. 
 Requisite information theory background will be covered as needed. Some of the topics will include case studies 
 into specific domains such as genomics and neural network model compression.
