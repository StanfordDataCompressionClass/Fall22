## Course elements and grading (tentative)
EE 274 is a `3 unit` course - auditing allowed with instructor permission. The graded course elements include:

- `3` assignments with both theoretical and programming components (`20%` each)
  - and a HW 0 to get you started (`5%`)
- Short quizzes (`5%`)
- final project (`30%`)
- [bonus] participation in the course (`5%`)

## Prerequisites
Basic probability and programming background (EE178, CS106B or equivalent), or instructorâ€™s permission. Background in statistical signal processing (EE278) and in information theory (EE276) may be helpful for appreciating some of the material, but is not assumed and the relevant background will be covered in class. Some of the final projects will be tailored to the students' backgrounds. 

## Textbook
There is no required textbook, lecture notes and slides will be provided as relevant. 
We might provide references to textbooks from time to time for additional reading.
